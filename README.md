## Covid Data Visualisation
This project presents a visualisation tool, written in Python 3, that plots COVID-19 data provided by the [Office for National Statistics (UK)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
It's the result of the course "Predictive Analytics and Data Security in the interconnected World" at the University of Applied Sciences Brandenburg in 2022.
The [full report](report/covid-19-report.pdf) can be seen in the report folder.


## Fields of Analysis
The application plots graphs for the following matters:
* Relationship between the amount of performed tests and reported Covid-cases
* Yearly Deaths between 1830 and 2019 in the UK, with a prediction for 2020 and 2021
* Relationship between Covid related deaths and overall deaths in the UK
* Daily Covid Deaths and the impacts of Lockdowns
* Distribution of Covid Deaths over age groups
* Leading causes of overall deaths between 2013 and 2020
* Relationship between pre-conditions and Covid deaths
